# CrypticGuard

**CrypticGuard** is a powerful file encryption service designed to secure your files on Linux systems. Utilizing a hybrid encryption approach with RSA and AES algorithms, CrypticGuard ensures that your sensitive data remains protected. Think of it as the BitLocker equivalent for Linux. A decryption key is stored securely on your USB drive, making it easy and secure to encrypt and decrypt files.
